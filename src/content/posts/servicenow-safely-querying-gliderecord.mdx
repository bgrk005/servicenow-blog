When working with the ServiceNow platform, `GlideRecord` is your primary tool
for interacting with the database.  Mis‑using it can lead to slow queries,
unreadable code and even security issues.  This article demonstrates some
techniques to write safe, performant queries.

## Avoid using `addEncodedQuery` with raw input

The `addEncodedQuery()` method lets you pass in an encoded query string.  It’s
tempting to build these queries by concatenating strings, but this pattern
makes it easy to accidentally introduce injection vulnerabilities.  A safer
approach is to use the dedicated query methods:

```javascript
const gr = new GlideRecord('incident');
gr.addQuery('active', true);
gr.addQuery('priority', '<=', 3);
gr.query();
while (gr.next()) {
  // process the record…
}
```

## Use `setLimit()` to bound large result sets

Always apply a sensible limit when you don’t need to process the entire table.

```javascript
gr.setLimit(100); // never process more than 100 records
```

## Index your tables

If you consistently filter on certain fields, ensure those fields are indexed.
You can create database indexes in the table’s dictionary entry.  Indexes are
essential for high‑performance queries at scale.

## Conclusion

By breaking your queries into discrete `addQuery()` calls and avoiding
string‑concatenated encoded queries you build safer, more maintainable
applications on the ServiceNow platform.
